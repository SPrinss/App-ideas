*List of ideas for apps to possibly build in the future*

## Cognitive/Life apps

### Solidification
**Problem**
During life we encounter 'important' lessons, either life lessons or those in a certain specialised field, that we don't incorporate into our lives. An example: A friend says that he/she really needed your help when he/she was down a year ago. You now want to remember to check in on your friends but since this event only happened once, it might be difficult to keep the lesson active. 

**Solution** 
An app in which you receive one randomly selected note (any type) you've once added each day as a notification on your phone. By reading the notification you activate the learned lesson and can,  if you so choose, act upon it. 

**Drawbacks**
It takes time to add a note manually. It might be difficult to take this time, 
especially if in a period on which you learn a lot.

### Dementia assistance app
**Problem**
For the circle around a person with dementia it's difficult to help this person from a distance. A call can solve a lot of problems but also takes a lot of time, and when the phone doesn't work, there is no alternative (and as a result, a lot of stress). Most dementia sufferers have, or are going to have, an tablet device. There are little to no good apps that enable you to assist the dementia sufferer with a tablet interface.

**Solution**
An app that enables the 'helpers' to:
- Ask questions
- Send reminders
- Record sound (perhaps)
- Play music/videos/slideshow (perhaps)

**Drawbacks**
What happens when you remind someone to take their medicine multiple times?
Difficult to maintain a balance between privacy and being able to help

### Life events app
**Problem** 
"Which year were we on vacation to Greece"? "When did you have to operation on your knee"? It's difficult for people to see a time line of their life.

**Solution**
A time line of your life on which you can zoom in and out. You can also search for certain events.

**Drawbacks**
How do you collect the data? Nobody is going to spend years adding data before they can use the app, so we need to import data from other apps (photos, calendar, mail, etc.).
We are handling incredibly privacy sensitive data.

### Health journal
**Problem**
The doctor asks: "How often did you catch a cold in the past two years"? Most of us can only give a very rough estimate. "How often were you happy in the past month?" 

**Solution**
Note keeping app with a tag-like system with graphs that show how often you had a certain occurrence.

**Drawbacks**
Privacy sensitive.
User input required.

## Boardgame apps

### Boardgame hosting app 
**Problem**
Unless your friends are available it's difficult to find people to play boardgames with. In the big cities some boardgame cafÃ©
's have had some success but those are sometimes crowded/relatively expensive.

**Solution**
A 'find a game in your neighbourhood' app. You can host a game or go to somebody hosting. You can enter your game preferences and skill level ('never played'). You can rate fellow app users.

**Drawbacks**
Do people like to invite strangers inside their house? Is the boardgame playing community big enough to bring enough traffic to the app?

### Dominion set picker
**Problem**
You have to create a set of 10 cards to play dominion. The current apps that enable you to do so have design issues (e.g. non-mobile friendly)
- Mobile friendly
- Beautiful
- Save a played set
- Downvote certain card combinations
- Set of the month

## Education

### Componentize lecture/presentation material
**Problem** 
Everyone creates their slideshow presentations/lectures from scratch while a lot of the content is very similar to those in earlier presentations. This results in a huge waste of time and effort. On top of this, the content isn't iterated upon/improved over time.

**Solution**
Style agnostic content blocks that you can import in you slideshow. Instead of creating it all yourself, you're assembling the content by importing blocks and (perhaps) modifying them slightly.

**Drawbacks**
Have to have a lot of content on the app before it become worth the while.
Slideshows tell one story; Is it possible/easy to tell this one story with assembled parts?

## Music

### Practice in all keys
**Problem**
If you want to train your musical technical abilities you often need to train in one musical key at a time. Which key this is doesn't matter much, as long as you train every key regularly. It's difficult to decide which key to play next while you are playing. The current apps that present musical keys all use non-musical time as a duration.

**Solution**
An app which presents one musical note at a time and switches after a musically based duration has passed


## Utilities

### Let me Google that properly for you
**Problem** 
A lot of people don't know how to search for information online. This hampers their ability to find answers to their questions / spend far more time than necessary.

**Solution**
An app that guides people to ask the 'correct' question. Either by helping them formulate the question more clearly or by providing options as 'search for a pdf'.

Vague ideas
### Change my view
**Problem**
The world is as you see it. Everyone creates their own version of the world depending on their current 'context'. This context is created by your past experiences but also by things such as your mood. Changing your 'context', for example by talking to a friend or taking a walk, can alter the way you look at a certain situation. 

### Hierarchy
How do I tackle a big task? -> Divide problem into different hierarchies -> Thesis help

### Life coaching questions

### Idea formation, incremental steps app

### Boardgame playing statistics with a group
